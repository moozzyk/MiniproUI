# Visual Minipro

The missing Mac OS app for [XGecu](http://www.xgecu.com/en/) programmers. 

I built [Visual Minipro](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6747261192) because I couldn't find a user-friendly way to interact with XGecu programmers (TL866CS, TL866A, TL866II+, T48, T56) on Mac.

## Features

### Read and write EEPROM contents

## How to get it?

### App store

Visual Minipro is available from [Apple app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/visual-minipro/id6747261192).

You can build the app yourself from this repository. However, it requires additional preparation of the [`minipro`](https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/minipro) tool as described in the Apple's [Bundles And Frameworks](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/bundles-and-frameworks) documentation.
